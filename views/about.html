<div class=row> <div class=card-panel> <h4>About LynxPics</h4> <br> <p>LynxPics was made by the Shout.Ninja team. This is a very early release, so please send us feedback via the <a href=/#/feedback>feedback</a> page. All of the content is user generated, so it is occasionally NSFW. Head on over to <a href=http://shout.ninja>Shout.Ninja</a>. <br> <br> <b>Dankness</b> <br> Dankness is pretty much a way to like photos that have been posted. If you like a photo, hit that heart button and it will add dankness. <br> <br> <b>Share</b> <br> If you like a picture enough that you want to share it, you can hit that share button in the bottom right. For now we just have Twitter, Reddit, and of course you can paste it yourselves. </p> </div> </div>
